Do not chew, divide, or crush the capsules. Do not take CREXONT with alcohol. Tell your healthcare provider if you: Have any heart conditions, especially if you have had a heart attack or irregular heartbeats Experience hallucinations or abnormal thoughts and behaviors Have an inability to control urges to gamble, have increased sexual urges, or experience other intense urges Have thoughts of suicide or have attempted suicide Have abnormal involuntary movements that appear or get worse during treatment Have ever had a peptic ulcer or glaucoma Become or intend to become pregnant.
